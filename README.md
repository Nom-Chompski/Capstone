Introduction
Purpose 
This document describes the implementation of the set of tools whose original software design and prototype was built by Dr. Paul D. Wiedemeier for the University of Louisiana at Monroe Biology department as a set of tools for the analysis and categorization of unknown Mycobacteriophage. Included in this version release, there will be a fully updated user interface and new features for analysis, taxonomy, and prediction. 
Document Conventions
priorities for higher-level requirements are assumed to be inherited by detailed requirements
Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions
The intended audience for the SRS is the people who will be administrating the software after implementation: ULM Biology, and ULM Computer Science.
Product Scope
The software to be produced is the application Phage Enzyme Tools version 2.0. The product will provide a specific set of tools to facilitate objective phage analysis for the benefit of the human race. Any general user of the application will have access to the tools and all of their uses therein. Any admin users associated with the P.E.T. v2.0 system are able to edit/add/remove information associated with changes in data on the system, and change permissions associated with any given general level user account. The updated P.E.T. v2.0 will provide an improved visual interface, improved analytics. It will also be equipped with more extensible data storage capabilities, and an entire administrator control section to manage and view enzyme and phage data entry and/or modification functions.

Overall Description
Product Perspective
This project is to improve the existing P.E.T. by Dr. Paul D. Wiedemeier for the ULM Biology department. 
Product Functions
The P.E.T. tool will have two distinct levels of user access, general user and administrative user.
All users will be able to Sign Up
All users will be able to Sign In 
All users will be able to Reset Passwords
All users will be able to set personal user preferences if there are any (undefined thus far…)
All users willbe able to cancel their account
All users will be able to have a clean log-out from the system 
All users will be able to use the current Phage and Enzyme Cut data in the database. 
View current Phage in the database and corresponding Enzyme Cuts 
Compare Unknown phage cut counts to known phage cut counts
Display Phylip generated phylogeny or restriction enzyme cut counts of known phage DNA (Both rooted and unrooted)
Access visualizations of cut location data for known Enzyme Cut counts on known phage
Administrator accounts have expanded usage capabilities via an Administrator Dash Board. 
Add new Administrator level users
Add new Phage Categories/Clusters/SubClusters
Add and/or remove data used by P.E.T. v2.0 manually or by .fasta and/or .csv file upload. (may include different file types)
View usage statistics for user accounts
User Classes and Characteristics
There will be two main user groups for this project. One will be users that are participating in the HHMI Phage Hunters research program, the other will be the administrating users from ULM. 

The users participating in the Phage Hunter program will be our general user base. The Main purpose of this tools use will be to compare the “Cuts” made by enzymes in the DNA strands of both known and unknown Phage.

The administrative users will be able to preform all the actions the regular users along with tasks that are limited to this access level. Some of these functions are updating/changing the database entries, entering new database entries. 
Operating Environment
This will operate on a server or virtual server. The Operating System can be any Linux Distribution or version of Windows Server. Some form of web server software (Apache 2 preferred), a Maria Database (MySQL 5 compatible),  and PHP 5 are also required. 
Design and Implementation Constraints
PHP 5.X
Maria SQL database (compatible with MySQL)
HTML5
CSS
Bootstrap
MINI PHP Framework
User Documentation
The Software will be accompanied by a manual and an online help file. 
Assumptions and Dependencies
This web application will be dependent on PhagesDB for complete genome sequencing. The cut data is derived from Nebcutter (see resources) via genome files from PhagesDB.
External Interface Requirements
User Interfaces

There will be one main interface in the application with a menu containing buttons to navigate to the home page, account settings page,  phage data tool page, and a log out button.

the database data can be maintained and updated from the administrators section.
Portability
The application is a web application that will be scalable to phones and tablets and usable on the most popular browsers.
Business Rules
Administrative users will have the ability to manage the phage data and update the database easily and will be limited to persons on ULM campus or other trusted individuals.

MVC - Model View Controller  
Appendix B: Analysis Models
Data Flow Diagram for MVC architecture:


Page Request from Users Browser to Sever
The invoked controller calls a model’s method to get/input data
The Model Queries the database
The database returns data or a confirmation of transaction to the model 
The model formats the data and passes it back to the requesting controller
The controller inserts the formatted data into a view. 
The content in the view is then passed back to the controller 
The controller serves the new dynamically built web page to the browser. 



Use case Diagram:

Appendix C: Use Cases
User
Register User: The registrant will enter information about themselves including required fields denoted by an asterisk; things like email, and first/last name and perhaps institution if made to be available exclusively through an educational foundation.
View current data: After completing user account registration, and granted access into the site, the user will be able to access all current phage and/or enzyme data that they choose within the limits of the P.E.T. v2.0 range of operation. Current data will also include recent news about changes to the site, which may or may not happen very frequently. However, and data changes site-wide will be displayed within the ‘News’ portion of the web-site.
Save session data: Any data generated from a user work session may be preserved by the user to the database with a limit of one save per user.
Export session data: Any data generated from a user work session may be downloaded by the user to their local machine’s hard disk drive in .txt file to the destination of their choosing.
User Admin
View current data: After completing UA log-in, and granted access into the site, the UA will be able to access all current phage and/or enzyme data that they choose within the limits of the P.E.T. v2.0 range of operation. Current data will also include recent news about changes to the site, which may or may not happen very frequently. However, and data changes site-wide will be displayed within the ‘News’ portion of the web-site.
View registrants: The User Admin may choose to view the list of active users of the P.E.T. v2.0 application. While in this view, the UA will have the option to change general user settings individually, thereby having the ability to ban certain users from the site or adversely grant them additional privileges per the needs of the situation. 
Edit phage/enzyme data: The UA will also have the ability to alter any phage or enzyme data associated with the site’s P.E.T. v2.0 application. This will include any information associated with individual phages, their clusters/sub-clusters, and enzymes and the cut ranges associated with them. After any and all changes have been made, the UA will be able to save the current state of the database and publish the changes made at will after completion
Appendix D: To Be Determined List
(1)  Set User Preferences
(2) Display Phylip generated phylogeny or restriction enzyme cut counts of known phage DNA (both rooted and unrooted)
(3) Access visualizations of cut location data of Known Phages
